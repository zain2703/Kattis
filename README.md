In this problem using topological sorting(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/) starting with connection having least number of connections. once we have the nodes according to their connections. we will use the lis algorithm(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-increasing-subsequence-dp-3/) which just find the longest increasing sequence and thats our largest group.

In this problem having one string which is having all new alphabets stored just printing that part of algorithm by giving its positon and length.

The task3.c and task3.cpp simply finds the maximum clique but they are using tree structure which will fail due to "exceeded memory" flag.
